## 📄 Journal Entry #1 – Ransomware Incident (Phishing-Based Attack)

**Date:** 25/11/2025  
**Entry:** Journal Entry #1  

**Description:**  
This entry documents a ransomware attack on a healthcare clinic. Phishing emails led to malware execution, file encryption, and system-wide disruption, preventing access to medical records.

**Tools Used:**  
SIEM logs • Email Security Gateway • Antivirus/Malware Scanner • Incident Reporting System

### 🔍 The 5 W’s

| Question | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Who** | Organized cybercriminal group targeting healthcare organizations |
| **What** | Employees downloaded malicious attachments, ransomware encrypted critical files |
| **When** | Tuesday at approximately 9:00 a.m. |
| **Where** | Multiple employee workstations and network environments in the healthcare clinic |
| **Why** | Lack of security awareness, no email filtering, execution of a malicious file |

---

**Additional Notes:**  
This was a targeted attack on a vulnerable sector. Highlighted the need for phishing training, backup strategies, incident response planning, and stronger email filtering. Uncertainty remains about backup availability or law enforcement involvement.

## 📄 Journal Entry #2 – Malware Hash Investigation & IoC Extraction

**Date:** 26/11/2025  
**Entry:** Journal Entry #2  

**Description:**  
Analyzed a suspicious file hash using VirusTotal and extracted related IoCs, categorized using the Pyramid of Pain.

**Tools Used:**  
VirusTotal • MITRE ATT&CK • OSINT Threat Intelligence

### 🔍 The 5 W’s

| Question | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Who** | External threat actors using phishing and malicious attachments |
| **What** | Password-protected spreadsheet executed malware, creating unauthorized files |
| **When** | 1:11 p.m. — Email received · 1:13 p.m. — File opened · 1:15 p.m. — Malicious files created · 1:20 p.m. — IDS alert |
| **Where** | Impacted internal network via employee workstation |
| **Why** | Poor awareness and insufficient email filtering allowed payload execution |

---

**Additional Notes:**  
File flagged as malicious by multiple vendors, negative community score, active C2 communication, and PowerShell execution. IoCs should be blocked via firewall, EDR, and SIEM threat feeds.
