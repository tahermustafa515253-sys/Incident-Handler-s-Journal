# Incident Handler's Journal

## Overview
This repository contains my ongoing Incident Handler’s Journal, documenting real-world cybersecurity incident scenarios as part of my training. Each journal entry follows the structured documentation style used in incident response teams, covering the 5 W's (Who, What, When, Where, Why), tools used, and observations.  
The purpose of this journal is to demonstrate key skills in **incident analysis, reporting, phishing investigations, ransomware handling, access control analysis, vulnerability assessments**, and response planning.

### 📝 Journal Entry #2 – Malware Analysis & IoC Extraction
**Description:**  
This entry investigates a suspicious file using VirusTotal to determine whether it is malicious. It analyzes malware behavior, identifies multiple Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), and classifies them according to the Pyramid of Pain. The entry demonstrates practical threat intelligence gathering, malware fingerprinting, and the use of MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

### 📝 Journal Entry #3 – Phishing Alert Response & Ticket Escalation
**Description:**
This entry focuses on responding to a phishing alert using a formal incident response playbook. The investigation includes alert evaluation, malicious attachment verification, decision-making for escalation or closure, and updating the incident ticket. The response process follows playbook procedures based on alert severity, sender analysis, attachment hash verification, and escalation guidelines.
